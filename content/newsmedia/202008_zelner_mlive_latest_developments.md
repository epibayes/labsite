[Michigan reports 539 new cases of coronavirus, 6 deaths](https://www.mlive.com/coronavirus/2020/08/michigan-reports-539-new-cases-of-coronavirus-6-deaths.html)

The latest COVID-19 figures for the state of Michigan show 539 new confirmed cases, pushing the total to 102,017.

Six additional COVID-19 deaths places the overall total to 6,473 deaths since the first cases in March, meaning 6.3% of those officially confirmed to have contracted the virus have died.

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services reports an additional 10,509 probable cases and 275 deaths linked to the novel virus.

As of Saturday, 76,151 people have recovered from COVID-19 in Michigan. A patient is considered recovered when they are clear of the disease 30 days after the initial onset.

[After 50 years in business, Michigan bowling alley to permanently close due to pandemic](https://www.mlive.com/news/jackson/2020/08/after-50-years-in-business-michigan-bowling-alley-will-close-for-good-due-to-pandemic.html)

After more than 50 years in business, Brooklyn Lanes will permanently close its doors.

The bowling center, 11522 Brooklyn Road, closed March 15 at the start of the coronavirus pandemic and is still not legally allowed to open. The lack of a reopening date at what should be the start of the busiest time of the year is too big of a financial hit to stay open, business partner Eric Hall said.

“We don’t even have a guideline coming saying, ‘Hey we’ll open on this particular date,’” Hall said. “The last one that we’ve seen is July 5.”

Closing their doors was the last thing they wanted, but the owners got to the point where they had no choice, business partner Diana Raab said.

“Yes, it was a financial decision, but in the end, we would give every cent we had to keep it going,” she said. “We didn’t want to let the people in the community down. This is something our community relied on. Parents see it as a safe place … to go locally instead of 30 minutes in either direction.”

[Still stuck on back-to-school? What Michigan health experts are deciding for their own kids](https://www.mlive.com/coronavirus/2020/08/still-stuck-on-back-to-school-what-michigan-health-experts-are-deciding-for-their-own-kids.html)

When it comes to health experts from across the state, opinions are split on the safety of sending their own children back into the classroom.

Some are adamant that limiting infection exposure though remote learning is the only safe way forward. Others see the benefits of in-person education and think parents need to take responsibility in enforcing health standards.

“From a health standpoint and until an effective vaccine is readily available or the virus mysteriously burns itself out, I cannot envision a scenario where COVID-19 safety can be guaranteed at school despite the best efforts of educators and public health officials,” said Dr. Larry Wile, medical director for the Van Buren and Cass District Health Department.

Father to a first-grader and a high school senior, he opted for virtual learning to start the semester. Van Buren and Cass School Districts offer a hybrid plan of in-person and virtual education.

“Knowing we can’t open the schools for in-person learning with a guarantee of safety for everyone involved makes me hesitate to say yes,” he said. “But I admit I am looking at this with my medical bias; I am not an educator or a pediatric developmental specialist.”

Without at-risk relatives, parents such as Jon Zelner, assistant professor in epidemiology in University of Michigan’s School of Public Health, are ready and relieved to be able to enroll his 3-year-old daughter in daycare.

“I feel more comfortable with my daughter, since I think she needs to go back,” Zelner said. “Nothing can really happen in this household while she’s here, which I’m sure a lot of people can relate to.”

[Why kids are playing football in Ohio but not in Michigan](https://www.mlive.com/highschoolsports/2020/08/why-kids-are-playing-football-in-ohio-but-not-in-michigan.html)

For parents like Jayme McElvany, it doesn’t make sense that a state with more virus cases is playing football and Michigan is not.

“Obviously, we were very angry and very confused,” said McElvany, whose son plays football at Milan High School, about 30 miles from the Michigan-Ohio state line. “Our numbers are better than (Ohio’s) and I feel like Michigan has done everything that they have been told to flatten the curve. The curve has been flattened for a very long time. Our numbers are below what is considered to be pandemic status or mildly worrisome.”

Hoping for concrete reasons and numbers from both the governor’s office and the Michigan High School Athletic Association, McElvany demands to know why families, coaches and athletes have to deal with the “logistic nightmare” of a spring football season.

“The numbers are not matching up what is being taken away from these children,” McElvany said.

McElvany also organized a “Let Them Play” rally at the state Capitol on Friday night as hundreds of parents and athletes gathered to demand the return of fall high school football.

Mark Uyl, executive director of the Michigan High School Athletic Association, has heard plenty of criticism on the decision to nix football.

“It’s been a lot of parents,” Uyl said. “I understand and respect that completely. There is a big part of my heart that, more than anything else, wanted to see my son, his teammates and everybody else to be able to play football this fall. I think since last March, all of us were just wanting some thread of normalcy in the worst possible way.”

## COVID-19 PREVENTION TIPS

In addition to [washing hands regularly and not touching your face](https://www.amazon.com/s?ots=1&tag=advancemichig-20&linkCode=w50&k=antibacterial+hand+soap&ref=nb_sb_noss_1), officials recommend practicing social distancing, assuming anyone may be carrying the virus.

Health officials say you should be staying at least 6 feet away from others and working from home, if possible.

Use [disinfecting wipes](https://www.amazon.com/s?ots=1&tag=advancemichig-20&linkCode=w50&k=disinfecting+wipes&crid=3HZH7H3G4F3WH&sprefix=disinfect%2Caps%2C154&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_9) or[ disinfecting spray cleaners on frequently-touched surfaces](https://www.amazon.com/s?ots=1&tag=advancemichig-20&linkCode=w50&k=disinfecting+spray+cleaner&crid=35YQDS5TUY35D&sprefix=disinfecting+spray%2Caps%2C150&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_3_18) in your home (door handles, faucets, countertops) and [carry hand sanitizer with you](https://www.amazon.com/hand-sanitizer/s?ots=1&slotNum=0&imprToken=1eb91415-7825-6440-3bc&tag=advancemichig-20&linkCode=w50&k=hand+sanitizer) when you go into places like stores.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has also issued executive orders requiring people to wear [face coverings over their mouth and nose](https://www.amazon.com/s?ots=1&tag=advancemichig-20&linkCode=w50&k=face+coverings&ref=nb_sb_noss_1) while in public indoor and crowded outdoor spaces.
