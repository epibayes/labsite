Many Michigan parents fear the return to school for their children.

Some have called the process “[total chaos](https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2020/08/back-to-school-is-total-chaos-for-michigan-parents.html).” Black parents in Detroit and Flint have talked about how [racial and economic inequalities](https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2020/08/back-to-school-conundrum-amplified-in-michigans-hardest-hit-communities.html) make the decision even more difficult.

When it comes to health experts from across the state, opinions are split on the safety of sending their own children back into the classroom.

Some are adamant that limiting infection exposure though remote learning is the only safe way forward. Others see the benefits of in-person education and think parents need to take responsibility in enforcing health standards.

**[Read more: Back-to-school conundrum amplified in Michigan’s hardest-hit communities](https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2020/08/back-to-school-conundrum-amplified-in-michigans-hardest-hit-communities.html)**


The question parents need to answer, said Dr. Larry Wile, medical director for the Van Buren and Cass District Health Department, is what are you going to compromise first: The potential health of your child or the educational and social benefits of attending school?

His answer ultimately leans towards health, though there’s room for some “grey area.”

“From a health standpoint and until an effective vaccine is readily available or the virus mysteriously burns itself out, I cannot envision a scenario where COVID-19 safety can be guaranteed at school despite the best efforts of educators and public health officials,” Wile said..

Father to a first-grader and a high school senior, he opted for virtual learning to start the semester. Van Buren and Cass School Districts offer a hybrid plan of in-person and virtual education.

“Knowing we can’t open the schools for in-person learning with a guarantee of safety for everyone involved makes me hesitate to say yes,” he said. “But I admit I am looking at this with my medical bias; I am not an educator or a pediatric developmental specialist.”

It’s comes down to a choice for each parent that requires doing their homework, Wile said. This means checking that school districts are following a list of health guidelines when they reopen, said Dr. Mark Hamed, medical director for Huron, Lapeer, Sanilac and Tuscola counties.

“Parents should ask what will happen if a child or staff member contracts COVID,” Hamed said. “What will they consider to be a ‘close contact?’ Will they have to send all the kids in the class home to quarantine or will it be a small cohort that the student was in? If a child is quarantined, what type of coursework will they have during that time? Will it be equivalent to in-person learning?”

Hamed personally felt safe sending his own children back to school, but erred towards caution with virtual learning since he has elderly relatives with chronic health conditions.

“We felt the risk was too high to expose them to a possible asymptomatic child,” he said.

Without at-risk relatives, parents such as Jon Zelner, assistant professor in epidemiology in University of Michigan’s School of Public Health, are ready and relieved to be able to enroll his 3-year-old daughter in daycare.

“I feel more comfortable with my daughter, since I think she needs to go back,” Zelner said. “Nothing can really happen in this household while she’s here, which I’m sure a lot of people can relate to.”

He feels comfortable the child center at U-M is equipped and organized enough to take on “an acceptable risk” when it opens Sep. 1.

His 6-year-old son, who attends Honey Creek Community School in Ann Arbor, is a different story. While the city has committed to virtual learning, he said he “wouldn’t know what to do” if his son had to attend class in-person.

“What are all the things that happen downstream from that?” he asked. “What’s the risk to him, to teachers, to parents and so on?”

School districts don’t have the time or funds to ensure all safety measures are enforced or installed in school buildings, said Dr. Dennis Cunningham, a family medicine physician for McLaren Hospital in Flint.

“School buses, you can’t really increase social distancing,” Cunningham said. “Classrooms are a fixed amount of space. In a crowded classroom, you can’t have each desk six feet away from one another.”

He echoed concerns about transmission to parents and relatives, while stating that infections within children are low. He has two children enrolled in Rochester Community Schools, which is going remote until October.

From first-hand experience, he saw how outbreaks ravaged capacity at hospitals in Flint. He worries about how the seasonal spread of influenza could exacerbate symptoms in COVID-19.

“We have multiple hospitals, and we were overwhelmed in terms of capacity,” he said. “There were just a lot of sick people. Some healthcare workers got sick, and in the back of my mind, I’m really concerned about the possibility that if we return to in-person, will we have an outbreak of COVID at the same time of influenza. That would really strain our capacity.”

The measures taken to control COVID-19 spread have contributed to low rates of pediatric deaths from the disease, Wile said.

“There have been 93 COVID-19 pediatric deaths (nationally) in the last five months,” he said. “Overall, these are extremely low numbers. However, I wonder what the COVID-19 pediatric death rates would be if we did not take the unprecedented measure of keeping kids away from each other with no school, sporting events, after school activities, play dates, playground usage, and entering public buildings. ...Therefore, I can only speculate that pediatric death rates from COVID-19 would be much higher than influenza had we not taken such drastic measures.”

There were 166 pediatric deaths from influenza in 2019, Wile said, on the higher range of the 37-to-187-death range from the last 15 years. Extrapolated over a full year with the same restrictions in place, there would be 223 pediatric deaths from COVID-19.

These numbers make Wile hesitate to recommend sending children back. Fortunately, many school districts, he said, are offering a hybrid model to optimize choices.

“I would advise each parent to make a decision that’s best for their child and their family,” he said. “Fortunately, most schools are offering choices between in-person education and at-home education or even hybrid educational opportunities

Moving forward, parents such as Zelner are taking a wait-and-see approach. In his case, this depends on how COVID is spreading throughout University of Michigan.

“Over the next six weeks, how are things going to turn out with U-M?” he asked. “How are things going to improve or not in our community? How comfortable are parents around me going to feel? Let’s wait and see and get more information to make a better decision.”

## COVID-19 PREVENTION TIPS

In addition to [washing hands regularly and not touching your face](https://www.amazon.com/s?ots=1&tag=advancemichig-20&linkCode=w50&k=antibacterial+hand+soap&ref=nb_sb_noss_1), officials recommend practicing social distancing, assuming anyone may be carrying the virus.

Health officials say you should be staying at least 6 feet away from others and working from home, if possible.

Use [disinfecting wipes](https://www.amazon.com/s?ots=1&tag=advancemichig-20&linkCode=w50&k=disinfecting+wipes&crid=3HZH7H3G4F3WH&sprefix=disinfect%2Caps%2C154&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_9) or[ disinfecting spray cleaners on frequently-touched surfaces](https://www.amazon.com/s?ots=1&tag=advancemichig-20&linkCode=w50&k=disinfecting+spray+cleaner&crid=35YQDS5TUY35D&sprefix=disinfecting+spray%2Caps%2C150&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_3_18) in your home (door handles, faucets, countertops) and [carry hand sanitizer with you](https://www.amazon.com/hand-sanitizer/s?ots=1&slotNum=0&imprToken=1eb91415-7825-6440-3bc&tag=advancemichig-20&linkCode=w50&k=hand+sanitizer) when you go into places like stores.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has also issued executive orders requiring people to wear [face coverings over their mouth and nose](https://www.amazon.com/s?ots=1&tag=advancemichig-20&linkCode=w50&k=face+coverings&ref=nb_sb_noss_1) while in public indoor and crowded outdoor spaces. See an [explanation of what that means here](https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2020/07/when-and-where-masks-are-required-in-michigan-now.html).
