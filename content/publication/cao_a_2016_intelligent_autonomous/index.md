abstract: "A system for autonomous camera control includes a first robot having a surgical tool mounted as an end effector and a second robot having a camera mounted as an end effector. A controller may be provided for manipulating the second robot, where the controller stores a first kinematic model for the first robot and a second kinematic model for the second robot. The controller may be configured to automatically manipulate the second robot to position the camera based on the second kinematic model and an expected position of the surgical tool according the first kinematic model of the first robot. The controller is further configured to identify a threshold angle from a viewing axis of the camera, calculate a tool angle from the viewing axis of the camera, and move the camera toward or further away from the tool depending on if the tool angle is greater than or less than the threshold angle."
