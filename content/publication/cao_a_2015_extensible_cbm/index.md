abstract: "Condition-based maintenance (CBM) of naval assets is preferred over scheduled maintenance because CBM provides a window into the future of each asset’s performance, and recommends/schedules service only when needed. In practice, the asset’s condition indicators must be reduced, transmitted (off-ship), and mined using shore-based predictive analytics. Real-Time Innovations (RTI), Inc. in collaboration with the University of South Carolina CBM Center is developing a comprehensive, multidisciplinary technology platform for advanced predictive analytics for the Navy’s mechanical, electrical, and IT assets on-board ships. RTI is developing an open, extensible, data-centric bus architecture to integrate shipboard asset monitoring data with shore-based predictive analysis tools. The interoperability challenge is addressed using the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) by transforming sensor data to rigorously specified standard data models. Our MDA process includes open standards such as the OMG Data Distribution Service (DDS) and Open System Architecture for Condition-Based Maintenance (OSA-CBM), both of which have enjoyed success in the Navy. Furthermore, the Navy’s Information Assurance (IA) requirements are implemented using the OMG Secure-DDS standard. In summary, the technology will improve combat readiness using a truly interoperable data-bus for exchanging CBM data from ship-to-shore while reducing distractions to the sailors, standby inventory requirements, and decision time for analysts."
