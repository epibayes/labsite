abstract: "Our research has focused on how to expand the capabilities of an Omni-Directional Inspection Robot (ODIS) to assist in vehicle inspections at traffic control checkpoints with a standoff distance of 450m. We have implemented an mast, extendible to eight feet, capable of carrying a sensor payload that has an RS-232 connection with a simple set of commands to control its operation. We have integrated a communications chain that provides the desired distance and sufficient speed to transmit a live digital feed to the operator control unit (OCU). We have also created a physically-based simulation of ODIS and our mast inside of Webots and have taken data to calibrate a motion response model."
