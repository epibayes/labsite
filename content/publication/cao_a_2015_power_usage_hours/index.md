abstract: "There are a quarter of million Americans that are living with spinal cord injuries. Every year 10,000 to 12,000 estimated spinal cord injuries every year in United States [1-3]. Partial or full paralysis may result depending on the level of spinal cord injury. The focus of this research if towards the C5 to C7 level of spinal cord injured population. These individuals with limited strength and mobility require assistive devices to improve quality of life.


There is a gap where the technology transitions from a simple-assistive device to full exoskeletal body suits. Most of the devices are being developed for people with amputations. This device would increase individual independence and hence quality of life. The device targets individuals with spinal injuries from C5 to C7."
