abstract: "This paper introduces a stand-off vibration sensor based on the Doppler radar principle and its application to helicopter drive train monitoring. The noncontact advanced vibration sensing radar (ADVISER) provides a wide field of view for comprehensive monitoring of systems and non-moving support structures within a common framework. The baseline performance of ADVISER is compared with a high-quality accelerometer in a well-controlled laboratory environment. In this paper we present the preliminary comparison of ADVISER with the accelerometers on the drive train setup at University of South Carolina. The evaluation includes a study on location sensitivity for ADVISER. The results show the ADVISER viability for drive train CBM."
