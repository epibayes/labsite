abstract: "Background: This study investigates the effect of a supplemental wide field‐of‐view (FOV) monitor on performance at high magnifications where the benefits of robotic surgery have greater importance.


Methods: Ten surgically naïve participants performed a simple aimed movement task under two different monitor conditions. The task is intended to emulate the need to locate an instrument outside the surgeon's FOV and return it to a ‘home’ position without the need to zoom. One monitor condition used a narrow FOV (25×) coupled with a supplemental wide FOV (3×). The second monitor condition used only a narrow FOV.


Results: Using a supplemental wide FOV in addition to a narrow FOV improved task performance by at least 33%, with greater consistency and reliability.


Conclusion: The supplemental wide FOV monitor provided additional information to the participant, allowing more efficient performance at high magnifications without the need for zooming."
