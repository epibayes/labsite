abstract: "Objectives: Detection of neoplastic changes using optical spectroscopy has been an active area of research in recent times. Raman spectroscopy is a vibrational spectroscopic technique that can be used to diagnose various tumors with high sensitivity and specificity. We evaluated the ability of Raman spectroscopy to differentiate normal pancreatic tissue from malignant tumors in a mouse model.


Methods: We collected 920 spectra, 475 from 31 normal pancreatic tissue and 445 from 29 tumor nodules using a 785-nm near-infrared laser excitation. Discriminant function analysis was used for classification of normal and tumor samples.


Results: Using principal component analysis, we were able to highlight subtle chemical differences in normal and malignant tissue. Using histopathology as the gold standard, Raman analysis gave sensitivities between 91% and 96% and specificities between 88% and 96%.


Conclusions: Raman spectroscopy along with discriminant function analysis is a useful method to detect cancerous changes in the pancreas. Pancreatic tumors were characterized by increased collagen content and decreased DNA, RNA, and lipids components compared with normal pancreatic tissue."
