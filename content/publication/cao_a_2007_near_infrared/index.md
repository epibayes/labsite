abstract: "Background: Raman spectroscopy is newly emerging technique in cancer detection that has shown a great potential in identifying tumors and different pathologic processes in adults. The recent development of efficient optical fiber Raman probes provides the opportunity to obtain real time diagnostic information during surgery and guide the surgical excision. No information is available about the application of this technology in children.


Design: We evaluated the usefulness of Raman spectroscopy in differentiating neuroblastoma (favorable, unfavorable and treated) from ganglioneuroma using fresh tumor tissue.


Results: 160 spectra were collected from 2 unfavorable histology neuroblastoma cases, 3 favorable histology, 4 treated neuroblastoma and one ganglioneuroma. Favorable histology neuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma were characterized by elevated protein and amino acid content compared to unfavorable histology neuroblastoma. However, ganglioneuroma differed from favorable histology neuroblastoma by the presence of specific carotenoids peaks. Treated neuroblastoma spectra showed higher intensity peaks related to specific amino acid and nucleic acid residues such as tyrosine, tryptophan and cytosine. Raman Spectroscopy was able to differentiate neuroblastoma from ganglioneuroma with 100% sensitivity and selectivity.


Conclusions: Raman spectroscopy can differentiate neuroblastoma from ganglioneuroma, which makes it a viable candidate for classifying pediatric tumors with potential applications for in vivo use as a real-time diagnostic tool."
