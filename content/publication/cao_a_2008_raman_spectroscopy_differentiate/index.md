abstract: "Raman spectroscopy shows potential in differentiating tumors from normal tissue. We used Raman spectroscopy with near-infrared light excitation to study normal breast tissue and tumors from 11 mice injected with a cancer cell line. Spectra were collected from 17 tumors, 18 samples of adjacent breast tissue and lymph nodes, and 17 tissue samples from the contralateral breast and its adjacent lymph nodes. Discriminant function analysis was used for classification with principal component analysis scores as input data. Tissues were examined by light microscopy following formalin fixation and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Discriminant function analysis and histology agreed on the diagnosis of all contralateral normal, tumor, and mastitis samples, except one tumor which was found to be more similar to normal tissue. Normal tissue adjacent to each tumor was examined as a separate data group called tumor bed. Scattered morphologically suspicious atypical cells not definite for tumor were present in the tumor bed samples. Classification of tumor bed tissue showed that some tumor bed tissues are diagnostically different from normal, tumor, and mastitis tissue. This may reflect malignant molecular alterations prior to morphologic changes, as expected in preneoplastic processes. Raman spectroscopy not only distinguishes tumor from normal breast tissue, but also detects early neoplastic changes prior to definite morphologic alteration."
