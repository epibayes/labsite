I just came across [this paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002082) by Adam Kucharski and co. using cross-sectional antibody titer data to understand the relationship between the ordering of influenza A infections and long-term antibody response, as well as the rate of decay in cross-reactivity in neutralizing responses.

Even though the whole flu world is a bit outside of my own personal wheelhouse, Iâ€™m a big fan of anything that [extracts temporal information out of cross-sectional data](https://www.jonzelner.net/downloads/papers/zelner_aje_2014.pdf), and thought this paper was a pretty excellent example of making the most of cross-sectional data and also highlights a pretty amazing dataset from a survey of antibody titers against influenza strains from 1968 to 2009 in southern China.
