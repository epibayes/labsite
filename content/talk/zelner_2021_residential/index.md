abstract: "In this tutorial, we’re going to walk through ways in which patterns of residential segregation may impact infectious disease risk through two different pathways, contact and susceptibility, and how that is likely to impact spatial and socioeconomic patterns of infection incidence.


To do this, we’ll build on the framework developed by Acevedo-Garcia (2000) to relate the social processes governing and generating residential segregation to the biological manifestations of disease.


Specifically, we’ll first walk through the hypothesized relationships between segregation and patterns of contact. We’ll then take a hands-on approach to understanding the way different intensities and modalities of segregation impact patterns of within and between-group contact. Finally, we’ll put these contact patterns into an infectious disease transmission model and look at their implications for risk, both at the population and group level."
