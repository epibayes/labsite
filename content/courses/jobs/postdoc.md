## Position Overview
The EpiBayes research group, led by Dr. Jon Zelner in the Dept. of Epidemiology and Center for Social Epidemiology and Population Health (CSEPH) at the University of Michigan School of Public Health seeks a postdoctoral fellow to work with us on a variety of projects relating to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza in Michigan and at the national level.

## About Us
We are a multidisciplinary, highly-collaborative group, with close connections to other research groups performing primary data collection at the University of Michigan and other institutions. As a group, we are broadly interested in understanding and addressing the key sources of spatial and sociodemographic variation in infectious disease infection and transmission risks. Our work covers a wide array of pathogens including respiratory viruses (COVID-19, influenza, RSV), bacterial infections (tuberculosis, Meningitis B, MRSA) and pathogens causing diarrheal disease (noroviruses, E. Coli, all-cause diarrhea). In this work, we integrate epidemiological data with environmental, spatial, and molecular data to reconstruct patterns of infection risk. The overarching theme uniting these projects is a focus on the use of cutting-edge statistical and simulation methods to understand and positively impact socioeconomic disparities in global and domestic infection risk.

## Qualifications
The ideal candidate will have strong quantitative and computational skills and familiarity with some combination of the following: **spatial analysis**, **Bayesian statistics**, and **transmission modeling**, as well as a background in **infectious disease epidemiology**. Candidates must hold a PhD, but field of study is flexible (e.g. epidemiology, statistics, ecology, social science) with suitability assessed primarily as a function of skills and experience. We have access to a wide array of detailed observational and prospective cohort datasets, and the ideal candidate will be comfortable developing an independent research agenda that builds on these sources of data and complements the research/policy priorities identified by Dr. Zelner and other members of the group.

## Additional Details
This position can be filled immediately, but the start date is flexible. The initial term of this position will be for two years, with the possibility of extension. This position will be all-remote until Spring 2021, with location thereafter to be determined in collaboration with the candidate and as a function of public health conditions. Interested candidates should send a brief inquiry and CV to Jon Zelner at jzelner@umich.edu.
