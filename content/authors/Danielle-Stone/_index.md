Danielle Stone is an Epidemiology Doctoral Student. Danielle was the first student to graduate from the new MS program in Computational Epidemiology and Systems Modeling at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. Additionally, she also received her M.P.H. in Hospital and Molecular Epidemiology from UM and dual undergraduate degrees in Public Health and Human Biology with a minor in Chemistry from Utah State University. For her MPH she has previously done work on virulence factors within the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome. Working on her MS, she conducted an initial exploratory analysis of NHANES data in effort to create a sexual network generator which could account for changes over the life course. She is passionate about bringing equity into health research, particularly in infectious disease systems and networks. In her free time, Danielle enjoys classical music, D&D, gaming, and pretty much anything else nerdy.
