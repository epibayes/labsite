In this tutorial, we will introduce some key concepts and tools for smoothing and visualizing potentially non-linear data. We will focus on local regression techniques for continuous outcomes, e.g. BMI, blood pressure, etc, in in one dimension, e.g. in response to some exposure, and in two dimensions representing x and y spatial coordinates. In a future tutorial we will look at complementary approaches to spatial density estimation which let us estimate the probability of an event occurring in space that build on the concepts discussed in this tutorial.
