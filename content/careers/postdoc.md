## Position Overview
The EpiBayes research group, led by Dr. Jon Zelner in the Dept. of Epidemiology and Center for Social Epidemiology and Population Health (CSEPH) at the University of Michigan School of Public Health seeks a postdoctoral fellow to work with us on several projects relating to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza and estimates/projections of vaccine efficacy for both of these pathogens. Drs. Emily Martin and Arnold Monto, co-directors of the Michigan Influenza Center will serve as secondary advisors for this position along with additional collaboration from investigators in the Michigan Influenza Center and University of Michigan School of Medicine. The person holding this position will be responsible for the analysis and integration of data from a unique combination of data sources including community-based household cohort studies, clinical studies in outpatient and hospital settings, and state-wide public health surveillance of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology.

## About Us
We are a multidisciplinary, highly-collaborative group, with close connections to other research groups performing primary data collection at the University of Michigan and other institutions. We are broadly interested in understanding and addressing the key sources of spatial and sociodemographic variation in infectious disease infection and transmission risks. Our work covers a wide array of pathogens including respiratory viruses (COVID-19, influenza, RSV), bacterial infections (tuberculosis, Meningitis B, MRSA) and pathogens causing diarrheal disease (noroviruses, *E. Coli*, all-cause diarrhea). The overarching theme uniting these projects is a focus on **the use of cutting-edge statistical and simulation methods to understand and positively impact socioeconomic disparities in global and domestic infection risk**.

## Qualifications
The ideal candidate for this position will have significant experience in statistical modeling of infectious disease transmission using detailed individual level data. Candidates must hold a PhD, but field of study is flexible (e.g. epidemiology, statistics, ecology, social science) with suitability assessed primarily as a function of skills and experience.

## Additional Details
This position can be filled immediately, but the start date is flexible. The initial term of this position will be for two years, with the possibility of extension. This position will be **all-remote until June 2021**, with location thereafter to be determined in collaboration with the candidate and as a function of public health conditions. Interested candidates should send a brief inquiry and CV to Jon Zelner at jzelner@umich.edu.
